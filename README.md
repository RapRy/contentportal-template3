<h1>Content Portal Template 3 (ReactJs Build)</h1>
<p>This is one of my earliest creation when I'm just starting to develop website. The inspiration behind the design and functionalities of this portal is based from the User Interface of ios. I developed this website using React Js but I have another version of this wherein I use JQuery, HTML5, CSS3, PHP and SQL and that version is the one that they are currently using in the company that I'm currently/previously employed. I decided to rebuild this website using react just to showcase my skill in using reactjs.</p>
